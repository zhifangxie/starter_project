allowed-tools: Bash(git status:*), Bash(git diff --staged), Bash(git commit:*)
---

## Your task:
Analyze above staged git changes and create a commit message. Use present tense and explain "why" something has changed, not just "what" has changed.

## Run these commands:
```bash
git status
git diff --staged
```
## Format
Use the following format for making the commit message:

```
<type>: <concise_description>
<optional_body_explaining_why>
```

## Output
1. Show summary of changes currently staged
2. Propose commit message with appropriate format
3. Ask for confirmation before committing

DO NOT auto-commit - wait for user approval, and only commit if the user says so.
